# A-Guide-to-Video-Organization-of-Embodied-Intelligence-Open-Source-Datasets
This material introduces the usage of common open-source datasets in the field of empathetic intelligence and how to convert them into video and corresponding caption forms to provide assistance for subsequent research.

We mainly introduced the [DROID](https://droid-dataset.github.io/), [SomethingSomethingV2](https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/software/something-something-v-2-dataset), [LIBERO](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO) and [CALVIN](https://github.com/mees/calvin) datasets.

[DROID](https://droid-dataset.github.io/)：Use the [DRIOD](https://github.com/xjtu-hwy/A-Guide-to-Video-Organization-of-Embodied-Intelligence-Open-Source-Datasets/blob/main/DROID.py) we provide to set your_droid_path as the path information of the DROID dataset you downloaded and save_directory as the address where you want to save the pictures

[LIBERO](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO): Use the [LIBERO](https://github.com/xjtu-hwy/A-Guide-to-Video-Organization-of-Embodied-Intelligence-Open-Source-Datasets/blob/main/DROID.py) we provide, set the folder_path_list, save_folder_list and prefix_path_list to start generating

The guides for CALVIN and SomethingSomethingV2 will be brought to you in the future…
